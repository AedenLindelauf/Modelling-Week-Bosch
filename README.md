# Modelling Week - Bosch Thermotechnology

**Participants: Bas Wijnsma, Justin van der Bijl, Pax Mallee, Domantas Stanys, Aeden Lindelauf**

This repository contains the progrms that were developed during the modelling week for Bosch Thermotechnology. The problem description can be found in [here](Bosch%20-%20Predictive%20low-order%20modeling%20of%20thermo-acoustic%20response%20in%20conical%20flames.pdf), which was written by Nijso Beishuizen. During this week, several different approaches were explored based, amongst others, on the following works:

The programs in this repository can be divided into three main parts (and their corresponding programs):

1. Modelling of the thermoacoustic interaction based on an analytical solution to a linearised version of the problem.
2. Using numerical methods to approximately solve the $G$-equation.
3. Using the results of either of the two previous programs to analyse the stability of the burner configuration and optimising a burner setup for the convective speed and fuel injector location.
